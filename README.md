### Wheel of Fortune

This is another one of those wheel of names that they do at your workplace's all hands.

## Motivation

This is a general front-endy project for me to show some frontend skills, TDD practices and basic devops stuff.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/)

This repository also has [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) configured to enforce conventional commit rules

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
