### Wheel of Fortune

Can you decide on what to do on the weekend? Can't decide who takes the prize? Why not use the wheel of fortune! 

P.S: I had used AI to help draw the canvas, but I've learned a lot about Canvas through it -- shout out to V0!

## Motivation

This is a general project for me to learn some frontend skills, TDD practices and basic deployment using Azure. There are some bugs with this project, so I will fix these when I find the time for them. Enjoy!
